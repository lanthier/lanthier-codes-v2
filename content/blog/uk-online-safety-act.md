The UK Online Safety Act has been blowing up in the news again as some of its hardest measures are being implemented: the act's third and final phase. Popular web applications, such as [Reddit](https://fidoalliance.org/reddit-implements-mandatory-id-verification-for-uk-users-under-online-safety-act/) and [Spotify](https://www.techradar.com/audio/spotify/spotify-introduces-face-scanning-age-checks-for-uk-uses-as-some-furious-fans-threaten-to-return-to-piracy), rolled out measures to require identification details. These include running biometric face scans, photo identification measures, and credit card details.

In a nutshell, the act is an attempt to protect children online to prevent their access to adult content. It will require any web application accessible to UK users to enforce age checks to prevent harmful content, threatening a fine of 10% of global revenue or potentially blocking their services.

This bill is a horrendous piece of legislation that at best is misguided and at worst is an attempt to vastly increase data collection on the UK population. This form of “child safety” regulation will exacerbate some of the worst problems of the internet and will not solve any safety issue that it claims to remedy.

People without proper identification will essentially lose their free speech entirely on the internet. Those lucky enough to have an ID will censor themselves, choosing not to post that [nonconforming tweet](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3l0e4vr0ko) critiquing dominant ideologies. If one uses an ID and biometrics, they are robbed of their privacy and any idea of what their biometric and other identification data will be used for. This act blatantly violates the privacy of millions and puts them at risk of surveillance, being doxxed, and ID theft.

Aside from making adults’ lives and the internet worse, kids will lose access to spaces they deem vital: spaces where they can find communities of people with similar interests, or even spaces that can get them out of dangerous situations. Many young people say that couldn’t have escaped some of the [worst parts of their lives](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/thousands-young-people-told-us-why-kids-online-safety-act-will-be-harmful-minors#:~:text=Without%20the%20internet%2C%20and%20especially%20the%20rhythm%20gaming%20community%20which%20I%20found%20through%20Discord%2C%20I%20would%27ve%20most%20likely%20killed%20myself%20at%2013.) alone. Child safety doesn’t exist in a vacuum online, they

Data surveillance, one of the worst problems of the modern internet, becomes a much more significant issue under this act; increasing tech giants’ behavioral surplus of data and amplifying digital dispossession of user information. Notice how not a single company changed its algorithms or data for UK users. Instead, they will gladly accept biometric data.

Privacy isn’t about having something to hide. It’s about having a space where you’re not constantly being watched, judged, or profiled. Laws change. Power shifts. What you feel comfortable sharing today might be something you will wish to hide tomorrow. The next time someone says, “I don’t care, I’ve got nothing to hide,” remind them: you’re not the one who decides what should be hidden.
