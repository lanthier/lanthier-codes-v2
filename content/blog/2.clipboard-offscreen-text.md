There is a surprising amount of bad or overcomplicated solutions on the web for copying offscreen text onto the user's clipboard in JavaScript/Typescript. While working one day I needed to fulfill a requirement of copying a link associated with some of our data, this is when I stumbled upon clipboard behavior in browsers.

## The problem

The problem is that it is a browser security problem to write text directly to a user's clipboard. The user needs to have an in-browser selection of the text that they wish to copy. Luckily for us, we have a work around.

## The solution

```typescript
copy() {
  let yourCopyText = "Whatever you need to copy goes here";
  let tempInput = document.createElement("input");
  tempInput.style.position = "absolute";
  tempInput.style.left = "-1000px";
  tempInput.style.top = "-1000px";
  tempInput.value = yourCopyTextHere;
  document.body.appendChild(tempInput);
  tempInput.select();
  document.execCommand("copy");
  document.body.removeChild(tempInput);
  alert("Success! Your text has been copied!");
}
```

And that's it! There are many solutions on Stack Overflow, codepen and other blogs that provide overcomplicated and long solutions but it is this simple. For those of you that are new to web development, let me show you to populate your text variable based on what you are doing.

**Copy your current url to the user's clipboard:**

```typescript
copyUrlToClipboard() {
  const currentUrl = window.location.href;
  let tempInput = document.createElement("input");
  tempInput.style.position = "absolute";
  tempInput.style.left = "-1000px";
  tempInput.style.top = "-1000px";
  tempInput.value = currentUrl;
  document.body.appendChild(tempInput);
  tempInput.select();
  document.execCommand("copy");
  document.body.removeChild(tempInput);
  alert("Current URL copied to clipboard.");
}
```

**Copy text from an existing element to the user's clipboard:**

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Your code is <span id="copyable">3432</span>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```typescript
copySpanToClipboard() {
  const copyableSpan = document.getElementById('copyable');
  let tempInput = document.createElement("input");
  tempInput.style.position = "absolute";
  tempInput.style.left = "-1000px";
  tempInput.style.top = "-1000px";
  tempInput.value = copyableSpan.value; // Use the value property
  document.body.appendChild(tempInput);
  tempInput.select();
  document.execCommand("copy");
  document.body.removeChild(tempInput);
  alert("Your code has been copied!");
}
```
