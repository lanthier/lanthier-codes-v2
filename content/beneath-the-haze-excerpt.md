# Beneath the Haze - Excerpt

Jape exhaled. He took a step towards the enforcer bots and darted his gaze at both of them. No change in behavior. Now a careful step with his left foot would put him parallel with the bots. He crept his leg out, waiting, expecting an act of defiance from either of them. When none came, he slowly and shakily put his foot down. The right followed, and the left. Jape matched each step with a look behind him on both sides of his shoulders.

Another left foot fell further than expected, onto the first step, which shocked Jape and forced him to inhale again. It was at the moment he realized his legs felt weak and his arms were trembling. He pressed his hands onto his legs to hide their shakiness as he continued down the stairs.

Liz awaited at the bottom, holding a plastic back with a uniform inside. "This is your uniform. You may change inside of the bathroom alongside the wall here, and shower, too. I will await you out here." Jape accepted the uniform from her hands, realizing he probably smelled terrible after not giving himself a wash this morning.

A brick wall met his eyes as he opened the bathroom door. The wall had two signs on it, one pointing him in directions toward the locker room and the other towards sinks and stalls. Jape walked left. In the locker room there were eight doors, four on his left and right. A running shower came from the first door on the right which was the only door that was shut. Jape chose the one across from it.

The room contained some hooks, a bench, some shelving with towels, and a shower. Jape took off his clothes and put them on the bench, set the bag with his uniform on top of them, and walked into the shower. Nothing happened. He looked at the shower head and then down from it, and realized he needed to pull some levers to turn it on.

The speed at which the water came out of the showerhead gave Jape a jump. For a moment, he stood in the shower in disbelief. The very next moment, Jape cupped his hands to gather a small pond of water and tasted it. The water was clean. Warm. This was the first time he ever felt a warm shower. He sucked up the pool of water from his hands and gathered another.

A laughter of joy followed the handfuls of water that hydrated his body like a crusty plant on hard soil on the verge of death. On the wall there was a box. Pressing it did nothing. Jape examined it for buttons or an interface. A noisy splooge dropped a transparent gel onto the floor. He squatted on the shower floor to study the substance. He scraped a small amount off of the gel on the floor with his finger tips. Suddenly, the noise came and splooge dropped on his head.

Jape jumped like a startled cat and smashed his head onto the box. "Agh!" He yelled. With scrambling hands, he flung the gel out of his hair onto the wall. On the wall laid muddy brown suds. Soap? Jape thought with another smell. He shook his head in embarrassment, as if being watched, of course it was soap.

Jape dried off and put his uniform on after his shower, replacing the uniform with the clothes that now stunk in contrast to himself. This was the cleanest he'd ever been since he came out his mother's body. Before leaving, he walked to the other side of the bathroom to see if the sinks also had working water. On either side laid eight sinks, four on both sides with mirrors above each.

He locked eyes with his father in the mirror. The bag fell from his hands as he became lost in his gaze for a moment. Jape walked towards the mirror and slowly felt his face, then analyzed the rest of his body and the uniform that laid on it. He turned on the sink, it worked. He turned it off. Tears dripped down his face as he sat for a moment with the fleeting memory of his father wearing the same uniform he had on now.
